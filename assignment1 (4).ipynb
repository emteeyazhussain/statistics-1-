    "Descriptive Statistics: This type of statistics is concerned with the organization, summarization, and presentation of data\n",
    "in a meaningful way. It provides a simple and concise summary of the data and describes the basic features of the dataset. \n",
    "Descriptive statistics can be used to describe the central tendency, variability, and shape of the distribution of data.\n",
    "Examples of descriptive statistics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of central tendency such as mean, median, and mode, which summarize the typical value of the data.\n",
    "Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation, which describe how spread out the data is.\n",
    "Graphical representations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, which help to visualize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics: This type of statistics is concerned with making inferences or predictions about a population based \n",
    "on the information collected from a sample. It involves testing hypotheses, estimating parameters, and making predictions \n",
    "about the population based on the sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of inferential statistics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing, which is used to test a hypothesis or claim about the population based on the sample data.\n",
    "Confidence intervals, which provide a range of values that the population parameter is likely to fall within with a certain\n",
    "degree of confidence.\n",
    "Regression analysis, which is used to examine the relationship between two or more variables and to make predictions about \n",
    "the outcome variable.\n",
    "For instance, an example of descriptive statistics could be analyzing the ages of students in a class by calculating the \n",
    "mean, median, and standard deviation to provide an overview of the age range in the class. An example of inferential \n",
    "statistics could be using a hypothesis test to determine whether there is a significant difference in exam scores between \n",
    "two groups of students who were taught using different methods."

    "\n",
    "Measures of central tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the average of a set of data. It is calculated by adding up all the values in the data set and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency when the data is normally distributed and does not contain outliers.\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a set of data when the values are arranged in order from smallest to largest. It is a useful measure of central tendency when the data contains outliers or is not normally distributed.\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of data. It is a useful measure of central tendency when the data contains discrete values or categories.\n",
    "Measures of variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a set of data. It provides a measure of the spread of the data, but is sensitive to outliers and may not be representative of the true variability of the data.\n",
    "Variance: The variance measures the average distance of each value from the mean. It provides a measure of how spread out the data is, but its value is in squared units, so it may be difficult to interpret.\n",
    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation measures the average distance of each value from the mean in the same units as the original data. It is a widely used measure of variability and provides a measure of how spread out the data is around the mean.\n",
    "Each measure of central tendency and variability can be used to describe a dataset in a different way. The mean and median provide information about the typical value of the data, while the mode provides information about the most common value. The range, variance, and standard deviation provide information about the spread or variability of the data. It is important to consider both measures of central tendency and variability when describing a dataset in order to gain a complete understanding of its characteristics."
